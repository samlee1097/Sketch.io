### User Stories

**MVP:**
User will be able to:
* Join a specific room with username & room ID
* Customize avatar before joining
* Draw on a canvas with different tools/colors
* Share the canvas with others through the chat
* Share live text and messages with others in the room

**Stretch goals:**
* Have a game where users guess a word to get points
* Allow users to automatically join public rooms without a room code
